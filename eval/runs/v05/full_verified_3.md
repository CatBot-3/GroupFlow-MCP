## Failures

### R01 (run 1): Repeats the date in other words

* step 1 (bob): outcome pending_review not in ['corroborated', 'none']
* bob said: “The party is Saturday at 6.”
  * Alexa: “I've recorded Saturday, Oct 17 at 6:00 pm as the party time, but since Alice owns that detail it's pending her confirmation — the current Oct 24, 6:00 pm stays in force until then.”
  * tools: get_context, propose_change; outcomes: pending_review
